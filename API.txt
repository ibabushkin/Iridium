- nodes are saved in a dictionary, with their id as the key, they can be removed
- all methods are taking an integer or a list of integers as arguments when they 
need a reference to one or mutiple nodes
- all methods get a clear documentation of the algorithm used, if not clear
- all loop variables get special names, not just i,j and k - this leads to 
confusion.
- make sure that variable names are clearly stating the purpose of the variable.
